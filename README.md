# **Education Funding and Performance Analysis Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes the relationship between funding, resource gaps, and student performance across various schools and regions. Using interactive visualizations, the dashboard provides insights into funding deficits, resource allocation gaps, and their impact on educational outcomes.

The primary goal of this project is to highlight areas where funding and resources are inadequate, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize educational performance.

## **Features**
1. **Funding Overview**  
   Displays the overall funding distribution and highlights funding deficits or surpluses for different schools and regions.  

2. **Performance Score vs. Funding**  
   Visualizes the relationship between school performance scores and funding levels to identify trends and correlations.  

3. **Resource Gaps**  
   - **Resource Gaps by School and Type:** Categorizes schools based on the severity of their resource gaps (e.g., minimal, low, moderate, severe, extreme).  
   - **Resource Gap Per Student Across Regions:** Displays regional disparities in resource gaps per student.  

4. **Student Impact**  
   Examines how funding and resource gaps directly affect students, providing a student-centered perspective on the funding problem.  

---

## **Dataset**
- **Data Sources:** The dataset includes information on school funding, performance scores, and resource allocation gaps.  
- **Key Fields:**
  - Funding Amount
  - Performance Score
  - Resource Gap Category
  - Region  
  - Student Impact Metrics  

---

## **Visualizations**
1. **Funding Overview:**  
   Visualizes total funding distribution across schools, with insights into surpluses and deficits.  

2. **Performance Score vs. Funding:**  
   A scatter plot showcasing the correlation (or lack thereof) between funding levels and school performance scores.  

3. **Resource Gaps:**  
   - Bar chart categorizing resource gaps by severity for individual schools.  
   - Comparative bar chart visualizing resource gaps per student across regions.  

4. **Student Impact:**  
   Interactive metrics showing the effect of funding on key student outcomes like academic performance and attendance.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Programming Languages:** Python (for preprocessing, if applicable)  
- **Tools:** Power BI for dashboard creation and insights generation  

---

## **Insights**
- **Funding vs. Performance:** Identified schools with funding deficits that correlate with lower performance scores.  
- **Resource Gaps:** Highlighted minimal gaps as the most common category, with significant regional disparities in gaps per student.  
- **Impact on Students:** Established a connection between insufficient funding/resources and negative student outcomes.

## **How to Use the Dashboard**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) to explore visualizations.
3. Navigate through the sections to view insights:
   - Funding Overview
   - Performance Score vs. Funding
   - Resource Gaps
   - Student Impact  

---

## **Potential Applications**
- Policy-making for equitable funding distribution.  
- Identifying underperforming schools for targeted interventions.  
- Analyzing the impact of resource allocation on student outcomes.  

---

## **Future Work**
- Incorporate more granular data on resource types (e.g., teaching materials, facilities).  
- Perform predictive modeling to forecast the impact of funding changes on performance.  
- Add regional filters for a more customized analysis experience.
